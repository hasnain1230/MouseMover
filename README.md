# MouseMover
A simple bot that moves the mouse around every ten seconds. Use to make certain programs think you're at your keyboard when you're actually AFK. Use at your own risk, I'm not responsible if you get in trouble lol. I just made this because someone asked me to.

# Usage
Hit `ctrl+shift+m` to active the mouse mover. Hit it again to deactivate it.
